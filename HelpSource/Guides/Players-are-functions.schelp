AbstractPlayer  is a subclass of AbstractFunction
therefore you can do math with them:

code::
//right now this works, but only with simple ugenGraphs, no Samples,Envs etc.
(Patch({ Saw.ar(400) }).wrap2( 0.5) ).gui


// not yet
(Patch({ Saw.ar(400) }).wrap2( KrNumberEditor(0.5,[0.0,1.0]) ) ).gui

//(somePatch * EnvPlayer.new(Env.newClear(10)) ).topGui
