------------------------------------------------------------------------

This toolkit contains class files and help files for using Ambisonics 
spatialisation with SuperCollider3. It may be used with loudspeaker arrays
as well as with headphones, providing binaural rendering with HRTFs. 

Installation: copy Classes into your SCClassLibrary and Help into your SC3 Help folder

Main Classes are:
    PanAmbi1O/2O/3O     Ambisonics encoding 2nd/3rd order
    DecodeAmbi1O/2O/3O  Ambisonics decoding 2nd/3rd order
    BinAmbi3O           Ambisonics direct decoding to binaural output
    RotateAmbi          Rotation in the Ambisonics domain
    Binaural            Binaural rendering of multichannel audio 
    Room2D/3D           Room simulation (early reflections)
    VirtualRoom         Easy to use class for creation of virtual environments

ambIEM encoders and decoders use the SN3D format. Note however that the channel order is not the same as recommended
in ACN (http://ambisonics.ch/standards/channels/). The mapping is:

IEM	ACN
0	0
2	1
3	2
1	3
5	4
7	5
8	6
6	7
