TITLE:: JITView
summary:: a modal view to show any object.
categories:: GUI, Libraries>JITLib>GUI
related:: Classes/MView, Classes/JITGui
Ndef
DESCRIPTION::
JITView can display an object as its source code,
change it by code, and do multiple actions with it.
It has a UserView for configurable display and interaction modes.
Its action is an MFunc to allow configurable actions when activated.
For flexible display of number(s), see its subclass link::MView::.
For modal guis for JIT-style objects, see MGui.


code::
// make a JITView: value, parent, bounds
j = JITView(123, nil, Rect(10, Window.screenBounds.height - 100, 300, 40));

// much of its internals are in a dict
j.dict;

// set its label (on the top left);
j.label_(\yo);
j.label_(\yoyoYO);

// if its parent is a window:
j.parent.name_("My JITView window");

// set its value - can be anything
j.value_(\symbol);
j.value_(nil);
j.value_( Pdefn(\abc, 123) );

j.value_(30);
// floats are shown as floats
j.value_(30.0);
j.value_([30, 300]);
j.value_([30, 300, 3000]);


// checkNum is a utility used to determine whether a value object
// is a number or numbers; in effect, whether it can be rounded:
// 0 if not a number, 1 if a single number, 2 if array of all numbers.
// (arrays of arrays of numbers not supported yet)
j.checkNum(12);	 // -> 1, can round
j.checkNum(nil); // -> 0
j.checkNum([12, 12]); // -> 2, can round

j.value_(10.123456); //default round is 0.0001
j.putDict(\round, 0.01).refresh;
j.putDict(\round, nil).refresh; //back to default 0.0001
j.putDict(\round, 0).refresh; // no rounding

j.action.add(\test, { |jv| "jv value is: %\n".postf(jv.value) });

// hitting enter on the view does action, or this:
j.doAction;

// BASIC display mode of JITView is \code;
// subclasses like MView have others, such as \number.
// as there is only one mode, there is no real need to switch to others
j.mode_(\code);
// shortcut: typing alt-c on the view also switches to code mode.
// or code shortcut:
j.code;

/* in code mode, one can enter any valid bit of code as value,
	and it will be shown as a compileString.
	-> tab to display current value as editString
	-> backspace to delete char,
	-> shift-backspace to clear editString
	-> return to try to enter:
		if ok:
			editStr becomes new value, doAction is called
		if it does not compile, nothing happens
			but a doAction on the previous value.
*/

// JITView can be hilited with a custom string and color,
// e.g. to show a mapping to a control source
j.hilite("sl1");
j.nohilite;
// customize hilite font and color
j.putDict(\hiFontCol, Color.magenta(1.0, 0.6));
j.putDict(\hiFont, Font("Inconsolata", 24));
j.hilite("sl1");
j.nohilite;

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: initClass
prepare styleDict



METHOD:: styleDict
a dictionary with colors and fonts for display.
it is parent to a local dict in a JITView, so many display params
can be individually overwritten.
code::
JITView.styleDict.printAll;
::

METHOD:: new
make a new JITView
ARGUMENT:: parent
a parent on which to display; if none is given, one is created.
ARGUMENT:: bounds
the bounds within which to display; if not given, bounds will be created.
ARGUMENT:: options
provision for display options, not used yet.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: value
get and set view's value, can be any object

METHOD:: valueAction
set view's value and do its action

METHOD:: action
the view's action, a modal MFunc.

METHOD:: doAction
evaluate the action.

METHOD:: parent
the parent view or window used for display.

METHOD:: bounds
the bounds used for display

METHOD:: dict
a dict for various data useful for the display.

METHOD:: putDict
put things into dict by pairs of key, value, key value.

METHOD:: uv
the userview which handles display.

METHOD:: doEnter
evaluate the action from keys.


METHOD:: drawFunc
the drawFunc of the user view, an MFunc which handles all configurable aspects of display.

METHOD:: prepDraw
prepare general data for display

METHOD:: drawLabel, drawValue, drawEditStr, drawHilite
methods for drawing label, value and editStr.

METHOD:: refresh
redraw user view.


METHOD:: hilite
hilite a JITView with a label and a color

METHOD:: nohilite

METHOD:: funcs
get all of uv's actions in one array [drawFunc, keyDownAction, mouseDownAction, mouseMoveAction]

METHOD:: mode
set and get the current mode.
modes must be present in the various action functions.

PRIVATE:: init, makeParent, makeBounds, makeDrawFunc, adjustFont, makeViews
PRIVATE:: makeMouseActions, makeKeyDownActions

METHOD:: makeVals
make n values with a function

METHOD:: checkNum
check whether a possible next value is a number or numbers or not.

RETURNS::
0 if not a number, 1 if a single number, 2 if array of all numbers.


EXAMPLES::

code::
// to follow - see also
MView.openHelpFile

// switch to a mode that only displays label,
// i.e. no code string, no editing
j.mode_(\nameOnly);
j.mode_(\code);
