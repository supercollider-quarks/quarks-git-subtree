related:: Classes/MFunc

DESCRIPTION::
MFdef is a named link::Classes/MFunc::, i.e. a named proxy for multiple modal functions.
As with all the *def classes, instances can be looked up and created by key,
and are accessible in a global dict called *all.

code::
(
MFdef(\m,
	    [
		    \ada, { "ada".postln },
		    \bob, { "bob".postln },
		    \dada, { "dada".postln },
		    \ede, { "ede".postln },
]);
)

MFdef(\m) === MFdef(\m);
MFdef(\m).value;

// can't set an MFdef with new args after its creation for now;
// maybe this should be supported later?
MFdef(\m, []);
